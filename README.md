## Description
- Starter app to get me comfortable with the JavaScript frameworks
- Backend focused (no React in this application)

## How it works
- Users must be logged in to do create tasks
- Once authenticated, users can create tasks for a certain date (POST to mongodb)
- Users can also view upcoming tasks and ones they already completed (GET from mongodb)

## Technical details
- Used express-session to authenticate users
- Rendered dynamic information to the client using EJS
- Used mongoose to create a user schema
- Explored nested collections through the user schema
- Updated and retrieved data from mongodb atlas
  
## Conclusion
- Basic yet fun project 
- Helped me understand nosql databases more
- Realized one of the greatest advantages of a node application is that the backend and frontend can all be written in the same language
